<h1>Paranormal Phenomena</h1>
<h2>The Study Of Unexplainable Sightings</h2>
<p>Paranormal events are purported phenomena reported and noted in popular culture, folk and other bodies of knowledge, whose existance is out of reach to the scientific-eye. Paranormal phenomena is also a pseudoscience, a statement that seems to be backed by science or data, but doesn't actually stand up under scientific studies; like astrology, since it hasn't shown it's effectivness in controlled experiments. Paranormal beleifs include spiritualism and ghosthunting. Looking at the paranormal from a researcher's perspective is most times difficult because of the lack of physical evidence from reported phenomena. Simply said; the paranormal doesn't follow the usual rules of nature. Despite this problem, researchers from different fields occationally study the paranormal. Many people report encountering strange occurences, such as feeling a presence in a room or experiencing unexplained noises. while skeptics often attritude these experiences to imagination or natural explinations, believers argue that that they point to something beyond our current knowledge. Paranormal investigators often involve looking for evidence to support these claims, using tools like cameras and EMF readers. The facination with the paranormal continues to captire public interest, leading to numerous books, films and television shows that explore these mysterious topics.</p>
